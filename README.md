# QuizApp

#### UPDATE 11 june 2020. 
- Is not fully functional, it's missing server side (I lost the code).
- I updated the app just for fun, I was struck by nostalgia. This is my first mobile app :)


#### UPDATE c. 2017. 
Android application quiz type with 15 questions and 4 options each.

**Update 3** (final) :  Save score and nickname of the player in a SQL database on webserver (HTTP POST and GET Request).
**Update 2** : I added new design elements ([check here](https://github.com/cristian-cojocaru/QuizAppAndroid/tree/master/Printscreens)) and the questions will appear randomly.
**Update 1** : This is the first fully functional version and in the future I will add new features.
